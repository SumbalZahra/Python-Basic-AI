# Python-Basic-AI
Basically this repository is useful only for new learners who are seeking to learn how basic python is used in AI, I will add lessons from BASIC AI course provided by Sir Irfan. You can find him at "(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tDE4hDaYgw&list=PLxf3-FrL8GzTIQpnY_UyzDX6JK0_Kbe_t&pp=iAQB)", he taught this course in Urdu, so this playlist is really useful for those how understand URDU or HINDI.
Feel free to point out errors if I make any, It would be very helpful for all of us. 
Appreciated!
